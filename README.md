**Uptown Shopper**

This is the REST API for a shopping list app, intended for use by my family. The aim
is to simplify our grocery list and shopping efforts, and to include features that empower us in our
weekly shopping chores and make the process as easy as possible. I don't know if this app will be useful to anyone else, 
yet, but I do plan to make it available for download when it is "finished".

This app serves two purposes: I want to build a better shopping list, but I will also use the app as a proving 
ground for my learnings and experiments. So, as soon as I finish the API in .NET Core, I will immediately 
rebuild it in another language/framework, so as to continue the learning process. 

**Current Status**

This app is a work in progress. The API, especially, is in need of major refactoring once the app is fully functional
and in daily use. I plan to use Entity Framework, the .NET ORM of choice, and I will add a full suite of tests using 
NUnit.


**Getting Started**

Coming soon!
